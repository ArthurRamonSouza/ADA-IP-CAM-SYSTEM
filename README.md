## DNN Models:

[First Mobilenet SSD try](https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD)
1. Worked, but need some adjust

[SSDs models](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd?tab=readme-ov-file)

1. VGG_coco_SSD_512x512_iter_360000 didn't recognize nothing, I think this isn't trained
2. VGG_coco_SSD_300x300_iter_400000 didn't recognize nothing, I think this isn't trained
